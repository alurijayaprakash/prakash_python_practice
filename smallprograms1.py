# Help : https://www.csestack.org/difference-between-remove-del-pop-python-list/
==> remove()   delete the matching element/object whereas del and pop removes the element at a specific index. 
==> del and pop deals with the index. 
==> The only difference between two is that- pop return deleted the value from the list and del does not return anything.
==> Pop is only way that returns the object.
==> Remove is the only one that searches object (not index).
